# Speech To Text

Speech-to-Text solution transforms spoken language into accurate, real-time text, making voice commands, transcription, and subtitle creation faster and more reliable. Built with advanced deep learning, it combines CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for contextual understanding, ensuring high accuracy across diverse accents, dialects, and noisy environments. A custom noise reduction algorithm improves clarity by filtering background sounds, while training on a diverse dataset makes the system inclusive and adaptable. With a word error rate as low as 5% and real-time processing, it outperforms traditional models and sets a new standard for accessibility, efficiency, and scalability in voice-driven technology.
