# 🗣️➡️⌨️ Speech To Text

We built a **smart system** that turns **spoken words into written text** — even when the speaker has an **accent 🌍** or there’s **background noise 🔊**.  
This tool helps people use **voice commands 🎙️**, take **notes 📝**, or create **subtitles 🎬** more accurately and easily.  
By using **advanced AI 🤖**, it understands different ways people speak and works well in noisy places, making voice-based tools **more reliable for everyone ✅**.
